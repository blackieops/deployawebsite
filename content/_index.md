title: Learn how to get your website on the Internet
body_class: index
---

The goal of this site is to instruct and educate those who don't have a background in systems administration on easy and powerful ways to host a web site on the Internet using modern security and scalability practices. It may not be as hard as you think, and in many cases you might not need servers at all.

If you're curious about systems administration but aren't sure where to start, it is our hope that hope these guides provide a useful avenue to your aspirations.
